## Overview

This interactive visualization tool demonstrates how popular pathfinding algorithms navigate through a grid to find the shortest path between two points.

## Features

- Real-time visualization of algorithm execution
- Interactive grid where users can place obstacles
- Side-by-side comparison of algorithms
- Step-by-step execution mode
- Performance metrics display

## Algorithms Implemented

### A* (A-Star)
An informed search algorithm that uses heuristics to find the optimal path efficiently. It combines the benefits of Dijkstra's algorithm with goal-directed search.

### Dijkstra's Algorithm
A classic algorithm that guarantees the shortest path by exploring all possible routes systematically.

## Technical Implementation

- **Language**: Python
- **GUI Framework**: Pygame
- **Grid System**: 2D array representation
- **Visualization**: Real-time color-coded cell updates

## How It Works

1. User selects start and end points
2. User can draw obstacles on the grid
3. Algorithm executes and visualizes the search process
4. Final path is highlighted
5. Statistics are displayed (nodes visited, path length, execution time)

## Educational Value

This project serves as an excellent learning tool for understanding:
- Graph traversal algorithms
- Heuristic-based search
- Time and space complexity trade-offs
- Algorithm optimization techniques

## Future Enhancements

- Additional algorithms (BFS, DFS, Greedy Best-First)
- Weighted edges support
- Maze generation
- 3D visualization
