## Project Overview

This sentiment analysis project focuses on classifying Amazon product reviews as positive or negative using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a model that can accurately predict customer sentiment from review text.

## Dataset

The project utilizes a large dataset of Amazon reviews, containing:
- Review text
- Star ratings
- Product categories
- Verified purchase status

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing
- Text cleaning and normalization
- Tokenization and lemmatization
- Removal of stop words
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF

### Model Training
Multiple models were trained and compared:
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Random Forest
- Neural Networks

## Results

The best performing model achieved:
- **Accuracy**: 92%
- **Precision**: 91%
- **Recall**: 93%
- **F1-Score**: 92%

## Key Insights

The analysis revealed that certain words and phrases are strong indicators of sentiment. The model can effectively identify nuanced expressions of satisfaction or dissatisfaction.

## Technologies
