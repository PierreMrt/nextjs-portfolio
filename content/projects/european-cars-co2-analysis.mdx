## Overview

Identifying vehicles with the highest CO₂ emissions is crucial for understanding which technical characteristics contribute most to pollution. This project analyzes European passenger car emissions data to predict CO₂ output and identify key factors driving environmental impact.

## Project Goals

- Analyze CO₂ emissions patterns across European passenger cars
- Identify technical characteristics that significantly impact pollution levels
- Build predictive models to forecast emissions for new vehicle types
- Provide interactive tools for exploring and comparing vehicle emissions

## Features

- **Comprehensive Data Pipeline**: Automated workflow from raw data to trained models
- **Advanced Preprocessing**: Data cleaning, outlier detection, and feature engineering
- **Machine Learning Models**: Random Forest regression with cross-validation for accurate predictions
- **Interactive Streamlit App**: Web-based interface for exploring data and making predictions
- **SHAP Analysis**: Explainable AI to understand which features drive predictions

## Data Source

The project uses the official European Environment Agency (EEA) dataset on CO₂ emissions from passenger cars under Regulation (EU) 2019/631, containing detailed specifications for millions of vehicles registered across Europe.

## Technical Implementation

### Data Processing Pipeline

1. **Data Reduction**: Remove duplicates, handle missing values, select relevant columns
2. **Preprocessing**: Clean column names, convert dates, normalize manufacturer names, detect outliers
3. **Feature Engineering**: Transform numerical features (engine displacement, power, mass, vehicle age) and encode categorical variables (fuel type)
4. **Model Training**: Scikit-learn pipeline with cross-validation for robust performance

### Key Technologies

- **Core**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, SHAP
- **Deployment**: Streamlit for interactive web application
- **Model Persistence**: Joblib with LZMA compression

## Streamlit Application

The interactive web app includes:

### Exploration Pages
- **Raw Data Analysis**: Visualize missing values, fuel type distribution, and outliers
- **Processed Data Insights**: Correlation matrices and scatter plots for key characteristics
- **Model Results**: Predicted vs. actual values visualization and SHAP explanations

### Comparison Tools
- Compare emissions across manufacturers
- Analyze patterns by country of origin

### Prediction Interface
- Input vehicle specifications to predict CO₂ emissions
- Real-time predictions using the trained Random Forest model

## Usage

The modular pipeline can be executed from different starting points:

- **From raw data**: Complete pipeline including data reduction, preprocessing, and training
- **From reduced data**: Skip reduction, run preprocessing and training
- **From preprocessed data**: Train models only

Individual pipeline components can also be run independently for development and testing.

## Results & Insights

The Random Forest model achieves high accuracy in predicting CO₂ emissions based on vehicle specifications. SHAP analysis reveals the most influential factors, helping manufacturers and policymakers identify optimization opportunities for reducing vehicular emissions.
