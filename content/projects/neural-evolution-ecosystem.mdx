## Overview

Watch evolution happen in real-time as creatures with neural network brains learn to survive, find food, and avoid predators. This simulation demonstrates how complex behaviors emerge from simple rules through natural selection and genetic mutations.

## Features

- **Neural Network Brains**: Each creature has a dynamic neural network controlling its behavior through sensory inputs
- **NEAT-Inspired Evolution**: Networks evolve through mutations—adding/removing neurons and connections over generations
- **Ecosystem Dynamics**: Complex predator-prey relationships between plants, herbivores, and carnivores
- **Species Divergence**: Creatures naturally form distinct species through genetic similarity clustering
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Live statistics tracking population dynamics, neural complexity, and evolutionary progress
- **Migration Behavior**: Creatures can evolve the ability to migrate when resources become scarce

## How It Works

### Neural Networks

Each creature possesses a neural network with:

**Inputs** (12 neurons):
- Energy level, age, and population density
- Direction to nearest food source
- Direction to nearest threat/prey
- Time since last reproduction

**Outputs** (4 neurons):
- Movement direction (X/Y)
- Action trigger (eat/attack)
- Migration trigger for long-distance movement

### Evolution Process

1. **Mutation**: Networks randomly evolve by adjusting weights, adding/removing neurons, and modifying connections
2. **Selection**: Creatures with higher fitness (survival time, reproduction success) pass on their genes
3. **Reproduction**: Successful creatures create offspring with mutated neural networks
4. **Speciation**: Genetic distance clustering maintains biodiversity
5. **Senescence**: Age-based reproduction constraints and lifespan limits create realistic population dynamics

## Technical Implementation

- **Language**: Python 3.8+
- **Graphics**: Pygame for real-time visualization
- **Architecture**: Clean architecture with domain-driven design
- **Data Analysis**: Parquet-based data collection for post-simulation analysis
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with pytest

## Key Insights

This project demonstrates:
- Emergence of complex behaviors from simple neural networks
- Natural selection driving optimization without explicit programming
- Species formation and ecosystem balance through evolution
- How age-based constraints affect population dynamics
- Migration as an evolved survival strategy

## Configuration

All parameters (mutation rates, population sizes, energy costs, neural network structure) are easily adjustable through a YAML configuration file, making the simulation highly customizable for different evolutionary experiments.

## Future Enhancements

- Sexual reproduction with genetic crossover
- GPU acceleration for neural network processing
- Phylogenetic tree visualization
- Extended creature types (omnivores, scavengers)
- Environmental hazards and seasonal changes
