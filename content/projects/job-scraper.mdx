## Overview

The Job Scraper project is a comprehensive web application designed to automate job searching across multiple platforms. It allows users to set up customized search criteria and receive filtered results from various job boards.

## Features

- Multi-platform scraping (LinkedIn, Monster, Indeed)
- Advanced filtering system
- User-friendly web interface
- Automated job alerts
- Data persistence and history tracking

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Django framework for robust web application development
- **Web Scraping**: Beautiful Soup and Selenium for data extraction
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for data storage
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript for user interface

## Implementation Details

The scraper uses intelligent crawling techniques to extract job postings while respecting robots.txt and rate limiting. The filtering system allows users to specify criteria such as location, salary range, experience level, and keywords.

## Challenges & Solutions

One of the main challenges was handling dynamic content loaded via JavaScript. This was solved by implementing Selenium for rendering JavaScript-heavy pages before extraction.

## Results

The application successfully aggregates job postings from multiple sources, saving users significant time in their job search process.
